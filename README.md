# Keepalive

A small, text-backed reminder service to remind you to eat and sleep.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

React? i guess

### Backend

#### Gateway

I'm going to cheat on AA (as usual for side projects at this scale) and use a combination of Caddy (a single static webpage and basic auth) for authentication and the simplest possible authorization scheme: non-rotating tokens and no shared data. The API deployment script will expect `caddy` in your path but all the features I'm using are native and stable in the current major version (2) so no need to vendor it in or anything.

#### Database

We're gonna use something that writes data to the disk in plain text. Right now I'm liking [diskv](https://github.com/peterbourgon/diskv).

#### API

Golang, maybe Gin.
